First, you need to copy the changes from the terminal and then paste in <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/\">gist.github.com</a>. This process is really time taking if you do it very often.</p>\n<p>So, I was looking for some automated method to create gists, I stumbled upon <a href=\"https://github.com/scottgonzalez/pretty-diff\"><code class=\"language-text\">pretty-diff</code></a>, a single line command that will create a GitHub gist with the changes in your git repository.</p>\n<h2>Install</h2>\n<p>Install <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/pretty-diff\"><code class=\"language-text\">pretty-diff</code></a></p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">npm i -g pretty-diff</code></pre></div>\n<p>Now create a <a href=\"https://github.com/settings/tokens\">Personal Access Token</a> (make sure to check “Create gist”). After that run this command:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">git config --global gist-diff.token &quot;AccessToken&quot;</code></pre></div>\n<p>Now you are ready to use <code class=\"language-text\">pretty-diff</code> and share the git changes.\nJust run this command and it will upload the changes to github gist.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">gist-diff</code></pre></div>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">gist-diff</code> will create a gist and then opens browser to URL of the gist.</p>\n<p>Happy sharing the code.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"How to create gists from command line","date":"December 10, 2019","description":null,"author":"shivam"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/how-to-create-gists-from-command-line/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/public-private-static-data-members-in-javascript/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Implementing public, private, and static data members in pre-ES5 Javascript","author":"shivam"}},"next":null}}}
