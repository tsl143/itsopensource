First, you need to copy the changes from the terminal and then paste in <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/\">gist.github.com</a>. This process is really time taking if you do it very often.</p>\n<p>So, I was looking for some automated method to create gists, I stumbled upon <a href=\"https://github.com/scottgonzalez/pretty-diff\"><code class=\"language-text\">pretty-diff</code></a>, a single line command that will create a GitHub gist with the changes in your git repository.</p>\n<h2>Install</h2>\n<p>Install <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/pretty-diff\"><code class=\"language-text\">pretty-diff</code></a></p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token function\">npm</span> i <span class=\"token parameter variable\">-g</span> pretty-diff</code></pre></div>\n<p>Now create a <a href=\"https://github.com/settings/tokens\">Personal Access Token</a> (make sure to check “Create gist”). After that run this command:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token function\">git</span> config <span class=\"token parameter variable\">--global</span> gist-diff.token <span class=\"token string\">\"AccessToken\"</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Now you are ready to use <code class=\"language-text\">pretty-diff</code> and share the git changes.\nJust run this command and it will upload the changes to GitHub gist.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">gist-diff</code></pre></div>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">gist-diff</code> will create a gist and then opens the browser to the URL of the gist.</p>\n<p>Happy sharing the code.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"How to create gists from command line","tags":["github","gists","how-to"],"date":"December 10, 2019","description":null,"author":"shivam","featuredImage":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/how-to-create-gists-from-command-line/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/public-private-static-data-members-in-javascript/"},"frontmatter":{"author":"shivam","tags":["javascript","oops","es5"],"title":"Implementing public, private, and static data members in pre-ES5 Javascript"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/how-to-setup-irc-and-irc-bouncer/"},"frontmatter":{"author":"shivam","tags":["irc","bouncer","how-to"],"title":"How to setup IRC and IRC bouncer"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["4268877247","764694655"],"slicesMap":{}}
